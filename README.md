# Housing Prices Prediction Model

## Overview
This machine learning project aims to predict housing prices based on property features using regression algorithms. It's designed to support real estate decision-making through data-driven price estimation.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Highlights
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Cleaned the dataset and handled missing data.
- Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.
- Implemented and compared different regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor  
- Used performance metrics such as:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - MSE
  - R2 score
## Results
The Ridge regression model produced the most accurate price predictions, demonstrating strong performance across all evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how regression techniques can be effectively applied to real-world datasets for property value estimation, offering a practical solution for modern real estate analytics.
